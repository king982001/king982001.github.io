      <h2>ROMANS 5:12-21(THE POWER OF GOD’S GRACE)</h2>
      <h5>We are studying the book of Romans, May 18, 2022</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
	    <br>
	    <br>
      <p>Last week from Romans Chapter 5:1-11 we talked about, what it means to be ungodly, how to be
saved, how to grow after being saved and how we can find peace with God. From the study we
also concluded that we can find peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Also
acknowledging that we are declared right in the sight of God (justified) by Our Faith (Romans
	      5:1/Romans 3:28), God’s Grace (Romans 3:24) and by the Blood (Romans 5:9).</p>
	    
<p>Since we are now at peace with God, from Romans (5:1-11), it meant that Jesus Christ had
completely overturned the effects of Adam’s sin on mankind. So in Romans 5:12-21, Paul takes
us on a journey and in his discussions, he used contrasting views for us to fully understand indepth on how we gained far beyond in Christ than what we lost in Adam.</p>

	 
	    <p>
		<b>Chapter 5vs 12</b>
Paul starts by giving a comparison that he doesn’t finish until the later verse (Romans 5:18-19).He
talks about how sin entered the world through Adam. When Adam disobeyed God, he sinned and
it resulted in death. Adam represented men, when he sinned, we were all counted as sinners.
	    </p>
	  
	    <p>
		    <b>Chapter 5vs 13-14</b>
When they is no Law they is no accounting of sin, but Paul is saying that sin was a reality in the
world even before the Law was there.14 He goes on to reinforce the idea of universal death in this
verse. Death was dominant on earth (reigned) from Adam to Moses and to those who didn’t even
sin the same way as Adam did. Paul also went on to refer Adam as a type of Christ. He goes on
with his comparison from (5vs18-19).
		    <br>
		    <b>The influences of:</b><br>
Adam_______________________brought sin and death upon men.<br>
Moses_______________________the Law which brought realization and accountability to sin.<br>
Jesus Christ___________________forgiveness of sin and eternal life.

	    </p>
	    
	    
	    <p>
		    <b>Chapter 5vs 15-19</b>
Everything lost in Adam was found in Christ. It was found not in equal proportions but beyond
measure. Adam sin brought death but the grace from God and Christ sacrificial act led to the
forgiveness of sin and justification as the permanent state of a believer.17 Through Adam’s sin,
death reigned but to the one who receives abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness will
reign in life through Jesus Christ .To those attached to Christ by faith, the benefit is far beyond the
judgment brought upon by Adam’s sin.18We see that, Adam is in the reign of sin and death but
Christ is in the reign of life and salvation.
Adams disobeyed and alienated us from God but Christ came to bring peace and reconciliation
between men and God. His sacrificial death on cross, was the ultimate price of our sin.
	    </p>
	  
	    <p>
		   <b>Chapter 5vs 20-21</b>
It is not the law that brings righteousness, it only reveals sin. Rather it is Christ and the grace that
brings righteousness leading to eternal life.21The penalty of sin is death and with sin death reigned.
Death reigned because it alienated us from God. And outside the presence and provisions of God
we die both physically and spiritually. However grace from God through our faith in Christ deems
		    us righteous and benefactors of the free gift of God. Which is eternal life.</p>
	    <p>
		    <b>Conclusion:</b>
1. Who is influencing you? Are you influenced by Adam, Moses or Jesus Christ?<br>
2. Are you in Adam or are you in Christ? [Denying Adam is denying your humanity. We are
all born into Adam but we are born again into Christ]<br>
		    
		    <br>May the Peace and Love of God abide in you always.</br>

      <h2>ROMANS 5:1-14</h2>
      <h5>We are studying the book of Romans, May 11, 2022</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>

      <p>Romans 5:1-14, talks about how we can be saved ,how to grow after being saved , what it means to be unsaved and how our relationship can be restored with God.
	 <br>From Romans 5 vs1-2 it talks about how we can be saved.Paul introduces the word justified which means to be declared right in the sight of God.
	    "And by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" meaning that our belief in Jesus Christ, his life , death and resurrection cements our
	    relationship with God.So this means if someone isnt finding peace it means that their relationship with God isn't strong.Its not strong because the cement to that
	    relationship is the faith that comes after the belief in Jesus Christ.We need to seek Christ for us to reach God."For noone can know the Father except through me", 
	    Jesus proclaimed in the gospels of John 14:6.
	    </p>
	 
	    <p>
		For us to be saved we are justified because of our faith, grace from God and our faith in the blood Jesus Christ shed on the cross.
		    In the book of Romans as discussed in the previous chapters, we are justified by our Faith(Romans 5:1/Romans 3:28),we are justified by the Grace of God
		    according to (Romans 3:24), and by the Blood of Jesus Christ according to (Romans 5:9/Leviticus 17:11).Therefore we can breakdown our salvation(being saved
		    as :
		    <b>God's Grace through our Faith in the Blood Jesus Christ shed.</b>
		    So we need to ask ourselves that are we truly saved and do we truly understand how our salvation came as children of God?
	    </p>
	  
	    <p>
		    Romans 5 vs 6-10 talks about how we can grow after being saved.When Paul wrote this later to the Romans , he knew that as believers we need to grow
		    after we receive our salvation.As believers we must not be fruitless Christians.At the same time we face tempation in our journey of faith."We can rejoice in our sufferings ,
		    suffering produces perseverance,perseverance produces character and character , hope."As children of God we must recognise and realise that we face trials,
		    and tribulations but they are not meant to harm us but to grow our faith.When the world suffers, it goes into bitter regret and lack of peace but because as believers
		    we trust in God and have faith in Christ Jesus, our faith will never put us into shame.We can take from the story of Job and how much he had to endure.Although it was
		    hard , he came out refined by the furnace of affliction into pure God.Job 23:10.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		    From Romans 5:6-10, it talks about what it means to be unsaved.It means to be ungodly, sinners and enermies of God.Since God is good and his natural reaction to
		     sin is wrath.As discussed by Paul in the previous chapter.So to be an enermy of God, it means they is no peace between you and God because of your ungodly
		    and sinful ways.But for peace to exist Paul talks about having faith in Christ Jesus, his life, death and resurrection.That faith brings peace and salvation to you as an individual.
	    </p>
	  
	    <p>
		    Lastly on Romans 5:11-14.It talks about how we have received joy and a restored relationship with God because of Jesus Christ our Lord , King and Saviour.
		    The significance of Christ and his death according to Romans 5:9 is his Blood.The Blood of Jesus covers a multitude of sin, the blood of Jesus is profound.
		    They is undeniable power in the blood of Jesus.Glory be to God Almighty and his word.We shall continue with our study of Romans 5:14-21 next Wednesday.
		    
		    <br>May the Peace and Love of God abide in you always.</br>
