      <h2>ROMANS 5:1-14</h2>
      <h5>We are studying the book of Romans, May 11, 2022</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>Romans 5:1-14, talks about how we can be saved ,how to grow after being saved , what it means to be unsaved and how our relationship can be restored with God.
	 <br>From Romans 5 vs1-2 it talks about how we can be saved.<br>Paul introduces the word justified which means to be declared right in the sight of God.<br>
	    "And by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" meaning that our belief in Jesus Christ, his life , death and resurrection cements our<br>
	    relationship with God.So this means if someone isnt finding peace it means that their relationship with God isn't strong.Its not strong because the cement to that<br>
	    relationship is the faith that comes after the belief in Jesus Christ.We need to seek Christ for us to reach God."For noone can know the Father except through me", 
	    <br>Jesus proclaimed in the gospels of John 14:6.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		For us to be saved we are justified because of our faith, grace from God and our faith in the blood Jesus Christ shed on the cross.<br>
		    In the book of Romans as discussed in the previous chapters, we are justified by our Faith(Romans 5:1/Romans 3:28),we are justified by the Grace of God<br>
		    according to (Romans 3:24), and by the Blood of Jesus Christ according to (Romans 5:9/Leviticus 17:11).Therefore we can breakdown our salvation(being saved<br>
		    as :
		    <b>God's Grace through our Faith in the Blood Jesus Christ shed.</b>
		    So we need to ask ourselves that are we truly saved and do we truly understand how our salvation came as children of God.So that when people <br>
		    as us when we became Christians and accepted Christ we got our salvation through the God's grace through our Faith in the Blood Jesus Christ shed.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    Romans 5 vs 6-10 talks about how we can grow after being saved.When Paul wrote this later to the Romans , he knew that as believers we need to grow<br>
		    after we receive our salvation.As believers we must not be fruitless Christians.At the same time we face tempation in our journey of faith."We can rejoice in our sufferings ,
		    <br>suffering produces perseverance,perseverance produces character and character , hope."As children of God we must recognise and realise that we face trials,<br>
		    and tribulations but they are not meant to harm us but to grow our faith.When the world suffers, it goes into bitter regret and lack of peace but because as believers<br>
		    we trust in God and have faith in Christ Jesus, our faith will never put us into shame.We can take from the story of Job and how much he had to endure.Although it was<br>
		    hard , he came out refined by the furnace of affliction into pure God.Job 23:10.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>5
		    From Romans 5:6-10, it talks about what it means to be unsaved.It means to be ungodly, sinners and enermies of God.Since God is good and his natural reaction to
		    <br> sin is wrath.As discussed by Paul in the previous chapter.So to be an enermy of God, it means they is no peace between you and God because of your ungodly<br>
		    and sinful ways.But for peace to exist Paul talks about having faith in Christ Jesus, his life, death and resurrection.That faith brings peace and salvation to you as an individual.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    Lastly on Romans 5:11-14.It talks about how we have received joy and a restored relationship with God because of Jesus Christ our Lord , King and Saviour.<br>
		    The significance of Christ and his death according to Romans 5:9 is his Blood.The Blood of Jesus covers a multitude of sin, the blood of Jesus is profound.<br>
		    They is undeniable power in the blood of Jesus.Glory be to God Almighty and his word.We shall continue with our study of Romans 5:14-21 next Wednesday.
		    
		    May the Peace and Love of God abide in you always.
