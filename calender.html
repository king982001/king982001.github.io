					2021 Scripture Union Events 
				</h1>
				<p>
					With the idea of imparting programming
					knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT
					Roorkee alumnus started a dream,
					GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming
					excites you or you feel stifled,
					wondering how to prepare for
					interview questions or
					how to ace data structures and
					algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a
					one-stop solution. With every
					tick of time, we are adding arrows
					in our quiver. From articles on
					various computer science subjects
					to programming problems for practice,
					from basic to premium courses, from
					technologies to entrance examinations,
					we have been building ample content
					with superior quality. In a short
					span, we have built a community of
					1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
					Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors
					in various colleges across the nation.
					Our success stories include a lot of
					students who benefitted in their
					placements and landed jobs at tech
					giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic
					network of geeks and we are only a
					fraction of it yet.
